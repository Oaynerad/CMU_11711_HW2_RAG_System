We’ll walk from the trailhead out to Bird Lab’s banding site, where we’ll have an opportunity to observe their operations and ask questions about the birds they are studying in Hays. Banding operations are weather-dependent, walk may be rescheduled to the following morning in the event of rain.Suggested donation of $20 per person to support Bird Lab research initiatives.",

We’ll walk from the trailhead out to Bird Lab’s banding site, where we’ll have an opportunity to observe their operations and ask questions about the birds they are studying in Hays. Banding operations are weather-dependent, walk may be rescheduled to the following morning in the event of rain.Suggested donation of $20 per person to support Bird Lab research initiatives.",

Through collaborations with his studio assistants and established print publishers, Warhol generated nearly 20,000 prints throughout his career. Screenprinting techniques allowed him to create series of images in an assortment of color variations, resulting in one of his most recognizable signatures (the same image rendered in different colorways), while the ability to generate editions of prints on paper enabled collectors to acquire masterworks at (relatively) affordable prices.
