Fri., April 4, 7:30-9 p.m. and Sat., April 5, 7:30-9 p.m.
Kelly Strayhorn Theater
5941 Penn Ave., Pittsburgh    East Liberty

Classical
La Voz que Soy, or The Voice I Am, is Afro-Latina soprano Zuly Inirio’s reinterpretation of the 1958 French opera La voix humaine. This multidisciplinary performance-in-progress uses the opera’s original framework—revisiting her past love through a final phone call—to explore colonialism, double consciousness, Black womanhood, and the African diaspora’s legacy. By intertwining these issues with the opera’s original themes of loss, assimilation, and the cost of self-preservation, La Voz que Soy highlights Zuly’s journey as a Black Latinx woman. The piece invites audiences into meaningful conversations about identity, resilience, and the shared experiences that connect us across diverse backgrounds.     412-363-3000
